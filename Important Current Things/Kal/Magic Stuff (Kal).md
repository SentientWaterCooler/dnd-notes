Kal looks desprate. Horns glow green, in a puff of leaves/detritus– teleports to rubble and leaves a path of moss in his wake

Kal’s horns are sharpening! Claws are growing! Oh man is he morphing.

Guys he’s an ent. Fun. Oh! You pushed him into the fey circle! 

Kal got told by a weird little voice that he can kill Meera if he annoys him so much. Jazzy. (Guys I’m so anxious for the record I think my hands are shaking 👍) Oh man are you and Kal fighting, and I am the worst for typing this scene :))**
