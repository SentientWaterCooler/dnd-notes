“Where the FUCK arae you? Yeah no shit. Do you know how many of our orators just got pinged. You unlocked an elder god of fucking fire.” sending 2 orators, 2 field agents, and an orator. In 4 days time. The boss is PISSED. Also he understands that things can get out of hand. Whole mission is to eradicate these things before they happen. Victor is new to this, but a prized agents. Hes special! A lot of augmentations. Higherups are willingto let this sliodew. They need thye sticlk asap. A LOT more messaged. You dont know what youve just opened up. Fire in neverwinter wood. Not supposed to be burning. Handlers name is ramseys. East of the north marsh deramouth mountain is gone. WHOLE MOUNTAIN. GONE. agents there unresponsive. A pit of lava there instead. Mass amounts of glaciers are melting. Assigning new mission post to victor. Get out of phandalin. Relic of primordial fire god will do shit to the area? Diviners arent lookin great. All bad visions so far. Cant promise safety until they get there. DONT LET ANY MORE SHIT HAPPEN. Hey victor? Please dont die.
