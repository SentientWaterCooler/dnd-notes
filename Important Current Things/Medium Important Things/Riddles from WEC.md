My challenge has had men through time stumble, i have defeated kings and left wise men humble.

You see me now but i am most often heard, and have killed men, with bullets paired.

Ypu might break a sweat when fighting me, but ill exert no pressure on your body. And with a direct approach you may never find victory, work laterally rather than literally. 

What am i?
