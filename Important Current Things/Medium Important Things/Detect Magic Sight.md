Looking at [[Kal - Kalyre Fleistro]] boots, stitching on his right leg starts mid calf, goes into the boot and almost creates a little knot, stitching stops then goes up his leg (threads) left leg stitching starts at the ankle; [[Magic Thread Colors]]  are; green black and orange

Kals hand has a sigil, etched in opalecent, not quite sickly but radiant yellow and green. Etching out from it are almost like veins. Kals face. Offset and almost deeper in is a second face, missing the jaw, teeth outstretched and completely wooden, irises are dark with a little green ring on it. Around his neck is a collar with chains leading away from it. Horns go down through his real skull and go through the wooden one.

[[Themis (Deceased)]]; all fire. Only fire.   

[[Victor Wilhelm Melstrom]]: looks normal. Tube on his back with the barry stick; unstitched threads around the bag, bands are green and white. Canister is just black. Light absorbing black. Aura of magics… nothing wild.
