Spoke to [[Kal - Kalyre Fleistroro]] through a squirrel (**Squirrel in the distance, Kal holds his hands out to say hi! Very cautiously starts crawling over, looks up and cocks its head, stands on its hindlegs mouth unhinges?!!?!??! AKMOST RIPPING ITS CHEEKS AT THE SEAMS. Eye not that of a squirrels, thing looks almost patchwork from different animals**) Person referring to themselves as kal's "grandma" speaks through the squirrel. 

"**Grandson, why havent you come to visit your grandmother in so long? I can tell you are getting stronger, so why have you not come to see me :( i expect you to come and meet me in the neverwinter wood**"

Kal did not think his grandma was alive. grandma responded in kind with "why wouldnt i be alive silly"
