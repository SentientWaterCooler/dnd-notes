>-Party starts in combat against Owlbear (CR3, cmon guys...)

>-Meera cured of exhaustion levels!
>-Party Travels to Agatha's manor, she does not know where last the spellbook was after trading it away some hundred years ago
>-[[Themis]]'s hat of disguise is traded for a map to [[Wave Echo Cave]]

We're half way to level 4, keep up the good work guys! Next session we should focus on side-quests a bit more (EG, helping rebuild the town, actually finding the spellbook {more info in [[Side Quests]]}, and generally ACTUALLY FIGHTING THINGS!!!! this is what the kids call level grinding. Please note; we can gain experience through getting information peacefully (like we did with agatha) however it should NOT be our first option)

highlights from the session:
-Kal's Owlbear Knowledge
-the history roll that manifested jake as meera's inner voice
-themis not knowing what a woman is
-themis sharing with the party how he was born
-themis shoving his hands into the fire and yelling "CLEAR"
-victor climbing a support beam and getting his shit rocked so quickly afterwards
-victors non-magical command spell "FLEE."
-kal's cool ass lore moment with the bonus turn
-meera wanting to know what his guts looked like
