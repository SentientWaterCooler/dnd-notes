Manor house wasnt destroyed like the village, it was left

Purple velvet curtain. Its new. What???

Enter the ladys room; well kept, brand new, mood lit with almost purple light, very pretty armchair with a woman in it! Or at least was a woman. Chandelier withe the lights. Whole room is fucking purple, couches and armchairs are red, floor is slate grey. Another chair and a fireplace.
