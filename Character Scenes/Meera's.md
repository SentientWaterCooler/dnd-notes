Water burns. Its painful. Just cold. Salty, but not the good way. Gets darker and darker and darker, looking for [[Mac Lir]]. Hit the ground hard, feel wood. On ship. 

  

There is no sun, like the ship is just in a gray void. Your ship is not the ship from sea of stars :3

The captain's quarters’ is below the bridge. Cassandra is above on another deck, with kind of dreams of people around doing random ship things. As you ascend the stairs of the ship, each step is harder as you turn into a child again, in the study. Your mom is not home. You try to leave but the door is locked, like usual. A man calls you ‘sir’ and asks if you are alright, you ask for food and he lets you leave the study. The scene changes, you are on the run and the ship is sunk. You try to get a room, but it is difficult because you have a weird ass name, and you're broke. Calls you a criminal and you had to leave and sleep in a back alley with a canvas as a blanket. You are surprised by an old woman in a cloak. She asks what you are doing in the rain and you say that it is personal preference, and it builds character. She tells you this is a stupid idea, and you say it’s hard to get by when you look the way you do. She offers you a stay and you try to refuse, you don’t want pity, but she insists. You keep failing perception checks, but you can tell that the rain doesn’t hit her. You refuse to come with her, and she insists that you call her if you need her, and places a gold coin with an unreadable imprint on it in front of you, and walks away. You grab the coin. It isn’t raining anymore. And you wake up. The coin is hung around your neck. (BITCHCOIN, MY NEW CRYPTO - Mac, 2024) It is a baularian obol.

**You wake up, the dream is over. (You have ao3 open on your own page nerd) You go to the blacksmith, your dog is following you.
