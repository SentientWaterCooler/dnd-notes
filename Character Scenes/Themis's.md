Themis in a group; learning. He finally got the skill he was learning down; first one to do it! Hes always the last one to understand stuff. Usually gets punished after every lesson; this one he got it and was rewarded! Was given an apple. First fruit he ever saw. Given to him by the ember mage– spell he learned was hellish rebuke. Shackled to the ground, embers all around him– been sitting for who knows how long. Trainers hitting the children, gashes deep but cauterize skin closed. Feels the hit, takes it in, remembers how to take it back out. 

  

In the lava, remembers how to give pain to others; themis, not as he was- dripping with lava eyes gone burned instead are sockets. Not themis anymore. No longer human. He no longer cares. He stands.

  

He teleports essentially; huuuug sword made out of lava appears; holdsit to ember mages throat. 

  

STILLA IS THE EMBER MAGE “dont give in”

  

“The collar” [[Stilla Halgrave]] says. A song so beautiful; calls themis to the staff. Steps through the bubble grabs the staff. If he holds onto the stick for too long he will die. Hand forced back around the staff, snaps in half as they jam through his heart. Themis is now gone, will taken over. Two people waiting for him in the light

  

A person emerges from themis’s chest, peels back themis’s skin. 11 foot tall man “now look what youve made me do.” METEOR STRIKES IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM, PILLAR OF FIRE ERUPTS WHERE HE STANDS
